        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add chicken cubes; cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium-high and add coconut cream and curry sauce.
            Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

        <li>
            Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil;
            stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally,
            until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes.
            Divide chicken and noodles amonge individual serving bowls.
